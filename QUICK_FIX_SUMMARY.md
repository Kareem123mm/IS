## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **TAs Now Appear in Dropdowns** ✅
- Fixed `uploads/instructors.csv` - added qualified courses
- All 25 TAs now have 4 lab courses each
- **Before**: Empty qualified courses → TAs not showing
- **After**: Full course lists → All TAs visible

### 2. **Time Constraints Applied** ✅
- Added availability check: "Not on X" preferences
- Filters instructors by selected day
- **Example**: Eng. Omnya (Not on Monday) won't show on Monday

### 3. **Lab Badge in Timetable** ✅
- Yellow indicator shows in lab course cards ONLY
- Message: "🧪 Lab Session: Only TAs can be assigned"
- **Location**: Timetable cells, NOT in regular lectures

### 4. **Enhanced Messages** ✅
- Shows: "✅ X qualified TA(s) available"
- Updates based on filters applied
- Clear and informative
