# ✅ Lab Session TA Validation - Quick Reference

**© 2025 Kareem. All Rights Reserved.**

---

## 🎯 What Changed?

**Lab sessions can now ONLY be assigned to Teaching Assistants (TAs)**, not Professors or Doctors.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### Automatic Detection
- System checks course **Type** field
- If type contains "**Lab**" → TA-only mode activated
- Example: `"Lecture and Lab"` → Only TAs allowed

### Visual Indicators
When editing a lab session, you'll see:
```
🧪 Lab Session: Only Teaching Assistants can be assigned
```

---

## 📋 Quick Examples

### ✅ Lab Session (MTH111 - Mathematics)
```
Type: "Lecture and Lab"
Dropdown shows:
  ✅ Eng. Omnya Shehata (Teaching Assistant)
  ✅ Eng. Nouran Moussa (Teaching Assistant)
  ✅ Eng. Zeina Ahmed (Teaching Assistant)
  
Excluded:
  ❌ Prof. Mostafa Soliman (Professor)
  ❌ Dr. Reda Elbasiony (Doctor)
```

### ✅ Regular Lecture (CSC111 - Programming)
```
Type: "Lecture"
Dropdown shows:
  ✅ Prof. Mostafa Soliman (Professor)
  ✅ Dr. Reda Elbasiony (Doctor)  
  ✅ Eng. Nouran Moussa (Teaching Assistant)
  
All qualified instructors allowed
```

---

## 🛡️ Validation Rules

### Two-Level Protection:

**1. Dropdown Filter (Prevention)**
- Lab sessions: Shows only TAs who are qualified
- Lectures: Shows all qualified instructors

**2. Save Validation (Safety Check)**
- Verifies instructor role before saving
- Blocks save if non-TA assigned to lab
- Shows error: `"Lab sessions must be assigned to TAs only"`

1. **Qualification Check** ✅
   - Instructor must be qualified for the course
   
2. **Lab Role Check** ✅ (NEW)
   - Lab sessions must have TA role
   
3. **Data Integrity** ✅
   - Prevents invalid assignments

---
