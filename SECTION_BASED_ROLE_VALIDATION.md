## 🎯 The Problem & Solution

### ❌ **OLD BEHAVIOR** (Wrong):
- Checked course **TYPE** (e.g., "Lecture and Lab")
- Applied same rules to both lecture and lab sections
- Result: TAs could be assigned to lecture sections ❌

### ✅ **NEW BEHAVIOR** (Correct):
- Checks **SECTION_ID** (LECTURE vs LAB)
- **Lecture Sections**: Only Professors and Doctors
- **Lab Sections**: Only Teaching Assistants
- Result: Proper role separation! ✅

---

## 📋 Example: CSC112 Course

### CSC112 - LECTURE Section
```
Course: CSC112 - Project Management
Section: LECTURE
Room: B18-F1.12 (Lecture)

Dropdown shows:
✅ Prof. Mostafa Soliman (Professor)
✅ Dr. Reda Elbasiony (Doctor)
❌ Eng. Omnya Shehata (Teaching Assistant) - EXCLUDED

Badge: NO lab indicator (it's a lecture)
```

### CSC112 - LAB Section
```
Course: CSC112 - Project Management
Section: LAB
Room: B18-G14 (Lab)

Dropdown shows:
❌ Prof. Mostafa Soliman (Professor) - EXCLUDED
❌ Dr. Reda Elbasiony (Doctor) - EXCLUDED
✅ Teaching Assistants qualified for CSC112

Badge: "🧪 Lab Session: Only TAs can be assigned"
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Change 1: Detection Logic in `editClass()`

**Before** (Wrong - checked course type):
```javascript
const isLabSession = course && course.type && course.type.toLowerCase().includes('lab');
```

**After** (Correct - checks section_id):
```javascript
const isLabSection = entry.section_id === 'LAB' || 
                     (entry.section_id && entry.section_id.toLowerCase().includes('lab'));
```

### Change 2: Instructor Filtering

**Lab Sections** (section_id = 'LAB'):
```javascript
if (isLabSession) {
    // Only Teaching Assistants
    qualifiedInstructors = allData.instructors.filter(inst => 
        inst.role === 'Teaching Assistant' &&
        inst.qualified_courses && inst.qualified_courses.includes(entry.course_id) &&
        isInstructorAvailable(inst, entry.day)
    );
}
```

**Lecture Sections** (section_id = 'LECTURE'):
```javascript
else {
    // Only Professors and Doctors
    qualifiedInstructors = allData.instructors.filter(inst => 
        (inst.role === 'Professor' || inst.role === 'Doctor') &&
        inst.qualified_courses && inst.qualified_courses.includes(entry.course_id) &&
        isInstructorAvailable(inst, entry.day)
    );
}
```

### Change 3: Save Validation in `saveClassEdit()`

**Lab Section Validation**:
```javascript
const isLabSection = currentEditingEntry.section_id === 'LAB' || 
                     (currentEditingEntry.section_id && currentEditingEntry.section_id.toLowerCase().includes('lab'));

if (isLabSection) {
    // Must be Teaching Assistant
    if (instructor.role !== 'Teaching Assistant') {
        showToast(`❌ Lab sections must be assigned to Teaching Assistants only. ${instructor.name} is a ${instructor.role}.`, 'error');
        return;
    }
}
```

**Lecture Section Validation**:
```javascript
else {
    // Must be Professor or Doctor
    if (instructor.role !== 'Professor' && instructor.role !== 'Doctor') {
        showToast(`❌ Lecture sections must be assigned to Professors or Doctors. ${instructor.name} is a ${instructor.role}.`, 'error');
        return;
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Key Differences

### Course TYPE vs Section ID

| Aspect | Course TYPE | Section ID |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Field** | `course.type` | `entry.section_id` |
| **Example Values** | "Lecture and Lab" | "LECTURE" or "LAB" |
| **What it means** | Course has both components | This specific class is lecture OR lab |
| **Used for** | Course categorization | Individual session validation |

### Example: CSC112

```
Course Info:
- CourseID: CSC112
- Type: "Lecture and Lab"  ← Course has BOTH

Schedule Entries:
Entry 1:
- CourseID: CSC112
- Section: LECTURE  ← This session is LECTURE only
- Instructor: Prof. Mostafa ✅

Entry 2:
- CourseID: CSC112  
- Section: LAB  ← This session is LAB only
- Instructor: Eng. Omnya ✅
```
