## 🐛 THE BUG

### ❌ **What Was Wrong:**

Filter by Type dropdown was broken:
- 🚨 **"All"** → Showed everything ✅ (this was working)
- 🚨 **"Lecture"** → Showed NOTHING ❌ (wrong!)
- 🚨 **"Lab"** → Showed EVERYTHING ❌ (wrong!)

### 💥 **Root Cause:**

In `app.js` line 920, the filter was checking:
```javascript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN):
const isLab = entry.course_type.toLowerCase().includes('lab');
// ❌ Checked course_type (e.g., "Lecture and Lab")
// ❌ For CSC112, course_type = "Lecture and Lab"
// ❌ includes('lab') returns TRUE for BOTH lecture and lab sections!
```

**Why it failed:**
- CSC112-LECTURE has `course_type = "Lecture and Lab"` → includes('lab') = TRUE → filtered out when selecting "Lecture" ❌
- CSC112-LAB has `course_type = "Lecture and Lab"` → includes('lab') = TRUE → shown when selecting "Lab" ✅
- Result: "Lecture" filter showed nothing, "Lab" filter showed everything

---

## ✅ THE FIX

### 🎯 **What I Changed:**

```javascript
// NEW CODE (WORKING):
const isLabSection = entry.section_id === 'LAB' || 
                     (entry.section_id && entry.section_id.toLowerCase().includes('lab'));
// ✅ Checks section_id instead of course_type
// ✅ CSC112-LECTURE has section_id = "LECTURE" → isLabSection = FALSE
// ✅ CSC112-LAB has section_id = "LAB" → isLabSection = TRUE
```

**Complete Fix:**
```javascript
// Type filter - Check section_id for LECTURE vs LAB
if (filterType !== 'all') {
    // Determine if this is a lab section
    const isLabSection = entry.section_id === 'LAB' || 
                         (entry.section_id && entry.section_id.toLowerCase().includes('lab'));
    
    if (filterType === 'lab' && !isLabSection) return false;
    if (filterType === 'lecture' && isLabSection) return false;
}
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### ❌ **BEFORE (Broken):**

**Generated Timetable:**
```
CSC112-LECTURE (section_id: "LECTURE", course_type: "Lecture and Lab")
CSC112-LAB (section_id: "LAB", course_type: "Lecture and Lab")
MTH111-LECTURE (section_id: "LECTURE", course_type: "Lecture and Lab")
MTH111-LAB (section_id: "LAB", course_type: "Lecture and Lab")
```

**Filter Selection:**

| Filter | Logic | Result |
|--------|-------|--------|
| All | No filter | Shows all 4 ✅ |
| Lecture | course_type.includes('lab') = FALSE? | NONE shown ❌ (all have "Lab" in type) |
| Lab | course_type.includes('lab') = TRUE? | ALL shown ❌ (all have "Lab" in type) |

### ✅ **AFTER (Fixed):**

**Generated Timetable:**
```
CSC112-LECTURE (section_id: "LECTURE")
CSC112-LAB (section_id: "LAB")
MTH111-LECTURE (section_id: "LECTURE")
MTH111-LAB (section_id: "LAB")
```

**Filter Selection:**

| Filter | Logic | Result |
|--------|-------|--------|
| All | No filter | Shows all 4 ✅ |
| Lecture | section_id === 'LAB'? NO | Shows CSC112-LECTURE, MTH111-LECTURE ✅ |
| Lab | section_id === 'LAB'? YES | Shows CSC112-LAB, MTH111-LAB ✅ |

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Filter Logic:

```
User selects "Lecture" filter
    ↓
For each class in timetable:
    ↓
Check: Is section_id === 'LAB'?
    ↓
CSC112-LECTURE: section_id = "LECTURE" → NOT LAB → SHOW ✅
CSC112-LAB: section_id = "LAB" → IS LAB → HIDE ✅
MTH111-LECTURE: section_id = "LECTURE" → NOT LAB → SHOW ✅
MTH111-LAB: section_id = "LAB" → IS LAB → HIDE ✅
    ↓
Result: Only lecture sections shown ✅
```

```
User selects "Lab" filter
    ↓
For each class in timetable:
    ↓
Check: Is section_id === 'LAB'?
    ↓
CSC112-LECTURE: section_id = "LECTURE" → NOT LAB → HIDE ✅
CSC112-LAB: section_id = "LAB" → IS LAB → SHOW ✅
MTH111-LECTURE: section_id = "LECTURE" → NOT LAB → HIDE ✅
MTH111-LAB: section_id = "LAB" → IS LAB → SHOW ✅
    ↓
Result: Only lab sections shown ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
2. **Generate timetable**: Click "Generate Timetable"
3. **Test "All" filter**: 
   - Select "All" from dropdown
   - ✅ Should show all classes
4. **Test "Lecture" filter**:
   - Select "Lecture" from dropdown
   - ✅ Should show ONLY lecture sections (CSC112-LECTURE, MTH111-LECTURE, etc.)
   - ✅ Should HIDE all lab sections
5. **Test "Lab" filter**:
   - Select "Lab" from dropdown
   - ✅ Should show ONLY lab sections (CSC112-LAB, MTH111-LAB, etc.)
   - ✅ Should HIDE all lecture sections

## 📝 Technical Details

### File Changed:
**`static/js/app.js`** - Line 918-924

### Before:
```javascript
if (filterType !== 'all') {
    const isLab = entry.course_type.toLowerCase().includes('lab');
    if (filterType === 'lab' && !isLab) return false;
    if (filterType === 'lecture' && isLab) return false;
}
```

### After:
```javascript
if (filterType !== 'all') {
    // Determine if this is a lab section
    const isLabSection = entry.section_id === 'LAB' || 
                         (entry.section_id && entry.section_id.toLowerCase().includes('lab'));
    
    if (filterType === 'lab' && !isLabSection) return false;
    if (filterType === 'lecture' && isLabSection) return false;
}
```

## 💡 Why This Bug Happened

### The Confusion:
- **course_type**: Describes the overall course (e.g., "Lecture and Lab")
- **section_id**: Describes THIS specific section (e.g., "LECTURE" or "LAB")

### Example:
```
Course: CSC112 - Project Management
Type: "Lecture and Lab" (has both components)

Section 1:
  section_id: "LECTURE"
  course_type: "Lecture and Lab"
  
Section 2:
  section_id: "LAB"
  course_type: "Lecture and Lab"
```

**Old logic**: Checked if course_type includes "lab" → TRUE for BOTH sections!  
**New logic**: Checks section_id directly → Distinguishes lecture from lab sections ✅

---

## ✅ Result

### Before Fix:
- ❌ "Lecture" filter: Shows nothing
- ❌ "Lab" filter: Shows everything
- 😤 Filter completely broken

### After Fix:
- ✅ "All" filter: Shows all classes
- ✅ "Lecture" filter: Shows only lecture sections
- ✅ "Lab" filter: Shows only lab sections
- 🎉 Filter working perfectly!

## 🎯 Related Fixes

This completes the section-based validation system:

1. ✅ **Backend CSP**: Assigns correct roles (Professors to lectures, TAs to labs)
2. ✅ **Frontend Edit**: Filters by role correctly
3. ✅ **Frontend Display**: Shows lab badges on lab sections only
4. ✅ **Frontend Filter**: Filters by section type correctly (JUST FIXED!)

**All components now aligned and working!** 🚀
